# Coolmovies web challenge

You have to add the cool movies review feature to the existing `coolmovies-frontend`. You are required to add a new `/reviews` endpoint to the application that renders a list of movies. A user should be able to add a new review with a rating.

We have created a basic app for you to get started in.

## Acceptance Criteria

**You will be evaluated on your UI/UX. We expect this to be at the level of a basic prototype; clean and clear flow.**

**You will be evaluated on critical thinking and decision making, so be mindful of any direction you take**

**You will be evaluated against your ability to understand and use the tooling provided and mimic existing patterns that are shown in the examples.**

There are 2 main components for  this feature, they **MUST** be completed and working:

1. Listing of the movie reviews.
2. Adding additional reviews.

Additional things we would like to see:

1. Our designers don't like the default MUI blue. Change this.
2. Make the proxied GraphQL URL an environment variable.
3. Add a few unit tests to your code. (These must pass).
4. Acessibility is important, [ARC Toolkit](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/arc-toolkit/chdkkkccnlfncngelccgbgfmjebmkmce?hl=en) extension is a good companion on this. Configure it to WCAG 2.1 and focus on **errors**.
